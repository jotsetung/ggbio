\title{Plot Splice Summary from RNA-seq data}
\description{
  Plot splice summary by simply counting overlaped junction read in
  weighted way or not.
}
\usage{
## For character,GRangesList
\S4method{plotSpliceSum}{character,GRangesList}(data, model, ..., weighted = TRUE)
## For character,TxDb
\S4method{plotSpliceSum}{character,TxDb}(data, model, which,
      ..., weighted = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
    A character specifying the bam file path of RNA-seq data.
  }
  \item{model}{
    A GRangesList which represting different isoforms, or a TxDb
    object. In the second case, users need to pass "which" argument
    which is a GRanges object to specify the region. And we get
    connonical model internally.
  }
  \item{which}{
    A GRanges object specifying the region you want to get model from
    the TxDb object.
  }
  \item{weighted}{
    If \code{TRUE}, weighted by simply add 1/cases matched to each model
    and if \code{FALSE}, simply add 1 to every case.
  }
  \item{...}{
    Extra arugments passed to \code{qplot} function. such as,
    \code{offset} which control the height of chevron.
  }
}
\value{
  A ggplot object.
}
\details{
  Internally we use biovizBase:::spliceSummary for simple counting, but
  we encourage users to use their own robust way to make slicing summary
  and store it as GRangesList, then plot the summary by \code{qplot}
  function.
